Use this space to write an abstract to your Thesis. It should be 3-5 pages long\footnote{Way too long in my honest opinion}, and be concise and to the point.

Describe what you thesis is about, referencing the most relevant contributions from the state of the art. Don't repeat yourself.

By the way, this text I'm dropping will serve as tutorial of the most relevant features of \LaTeX, and hopefully will guide you towards a beautiful essay.
