About this package
============

This Template is robust enough for you to use as Master Thesis template in Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. It was, in fact, used by several people in 2017 at the NEARLab.

Some tutorials are provided inside the files, which are commented in a reasonable manner. The main file is `Tesi.tex`, which calls all of the remainder. This is a first step towards a fully updatable latex template, which is on a TODO list.

As a good practice, I advice to create new folders in the working project: Figures and Tables, and use them to keep both high resolution image files and `*.tex` source codes for Figures and Tables, which will be later called in the manuscript chapter using `\input{}`.
