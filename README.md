The Polimi Press Package
================

Welcome to the _Polimi Press Package_, comprising themes and templates for the most popular applications for word-editing and presentations.
All the files in this repo are developed for the students of Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. For this reason, the remainder of the files will use Italian as main language.

*Not Italian* / *Not of Biomedical Engineering?* Do not worry! Just send me an e-mail or open an [issue](https://github.com/daemonPainter/polimi-press-package/issues) and I'll
do my best to provide new files and translations.

1) Scope of the repository
------------------------------

Develop a large enough project, like a Thesis, is enough work for a small enough group of people. Typesetting the whole thing on top of making sense of the phrases and create a decent presentation
may require too much (unavailable) time. Doing so following all of the prescribed rules set by the Politecnico is a dream for most people.
By releasing these files under the [MIT Licence](https://github.com/daemonPainter/polimi-press-package/blob/master/LICENSE) I hope to ease a lot of work from your shoulders. In here you will find templates, styling files, examples and so on for diverse popular applications.
You may downoad them, install them and customize them to fullfil your most higher expectations.

2) Architecture of the repository
-------------------------------------

The repo is organized as follows:

```
..\School (e.g. Biomedical Engineering)
  |-\Presentations
  | |- MS PowerPoint
  |-\Publications
  | |-\LaTeX templates
  |   |-\Master Thesis
```

3) Disclaimer
---------------

All files are provided as they are, with no implicit or explicit warranty of any kind. While I always do my best to provide top notch quality of files, I'm only human and working on this project in my spare time.
For a professional level editing, issue-tracking and service, consider [hiring](mailto:mail@gabrieleomodeo.it) me.

4) F.A.Q.s
-----------

##### Why isn't my School / Study course represented in the repo?

Probably because I didn't have the chance to look up the rules specific for your course and make the necessary modifications to the files. You can open a [ticket](https://github.com/daemonPainter/polimi-press-package/issues) suggesting the files with the rules specific to your School.
While I may not look into it immediately, I'll do my best to update this as often as I can

##### I want to contribute, how can I?

You can open a [ticket](https://github.com/daemonPainter/polimi-press-package/issues) suggesting new features, reporting bugs and discussing in general. You can always send up your files to the repo, just use the correct file structure (see section 3) and clear up any whopsie-commits before pushing.
