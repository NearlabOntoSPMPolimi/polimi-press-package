Polimi Press Package
==============

Welcome to the _Polimi Press Package_, comprising themes and templates for the most popular applications for word-editing and presentations.
All the files in this repo are developed for the students of Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. For this reason, the remainder of the files will use Italian as main language.

Not Italian / not of Biomedical Engineering? Do not worry! Just send me an e-mail or open an [issue](https://github.com/daemonPainter/polimi-press-package/issues) and I'll
do my best to provide new files and translations.
