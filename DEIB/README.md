# This is the awesome Classic Thesis @ DEIB template

This is a subtree merge of the original package available [here](https://github.com/Lordmzn/ClassicThesis-at-DEIB/). The Classic Thesis @ DEIB is a modified version of Classic Thesis by André Miede that can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis/wiki/Home).
Plese refer to `CT_DEIB_Template_Tutorial.pdf` for a tutorial on the usage.

Remember to credit the Authors. In particular, André Miede, who made the majority of the work, is collecting postcards from around the world sent by those who used his template. Consider sending him one (refer to his repository for information).

## Warnings with respect to Polimi thesis rules compliance

The original package, while being an astonishing piece of work, may not be compliant to the guidelines provided by the single Schools on how to design the thesis template. Please be careful, as the package is provided as is, without any warranty.

## Major changes during merging

In order to preserve consistency of the Polimi Press Package, some changes to structure and file content of the original package was made.

In particular:

+ the PowerPoint presentation has been removed (and will be substituted with the latest Polimi template asap);
+ Folder names have changed to be consistent.
